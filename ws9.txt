I created a shell script "randomsample.sh" with the following contents:

#!/bin/bash
numregex="^[0-9]+$";
if [[ -z $1 || "$1" =~ ^[^[0-9]+]$ || $1 -le 0 || $1 -ge 100 ]];
then echo "Error: $1 is an invalid integer between 1 and 99." >&2; exit 1;
fi;
if [ -z $2 ];
then echo "Error: Missing input file for 2nd parameter.";
fi;
# echo $1% of the lines in the input file.
while read line;
do
        if [ $(($RANDOM % 100)) -le $1 ];
        then echo "$line";
        fi;
done < $2;
exit 0;

I then ran the shell script--which given the current arguments would print 99% of my amazon dataset's lines randomly--using the following commands:

db=./amazon_reviews_us_Books_v1_02.tsv;
chmod 777 randomsample.sh
./randomsample.sh "99" "$db"

The first argument, "99", can be changed with any integer between 1 and 99 to indicate a percentage of the file to print. The second argument, $db, can be changed to be another file that has multiple lines in it.
